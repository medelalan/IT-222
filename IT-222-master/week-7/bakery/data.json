It’s a classic that still elevates expectations as a foundation or side. Spread a grainy mustard and top with shaved roast for a delicious sandwich, or toast and butter generously to serve with Saturday morning’s bacon and eggs.",

This loaf tends to get devoured pretty quick, so make sure you save yourself a slice! Toast it for the perfect BLT, or give it the grilled cheese treatment and dip into creamy tomato soup to spark some childhood memories.",
